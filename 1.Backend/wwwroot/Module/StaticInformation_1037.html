Those are painful and horrible experiences that haunted my childhood. Those days the technology was not yet developed, all treatments had to be treated with no anesthesia. Thus, I wished that I would have a beautiful smile and a happy life when I grow up and I wanted to bring the same wish to everyone. Therefore, I decided to become a dentist.</p><p>Becoming a dentist was not easy for me because I had to study hard to overcome millions of other students to win a ticket to the most prestigious University in Vietnam: Ho Chi Minh City University of Medicine.</p><p>The dream kept growing with me over the years, now my profession is my passion and my life. Every day is an adventure and the opportunity to help others is a gift to me. The chance to heal, eliminate someone’s pain, and help someone to love their smile and themselves is the most rewarding experience I can think of. I have other dreams:</p><p>I love my country, Vietnam, the beautiful country in the S-shaped. A country suffered too much pain and loss due to war. It had gone through thousands of battles over thousands of years, thousands of years suffered from the invasion of Chinese aggressors and hundreds of years under the invasion of the Western empire. Now, to live in peace, I wish to bring benefits and foreign currency to my country.<p><p> I dream that, the medical services and health practitioners in Vietnam will be recognized by many people around the world with one of the best qualities, services, and safety and effective techniques. </p><p> I dream that my colleagues and I would have the opportunity to make people feel better about themselves and their beautiful smiles, confidence, happiness and success to the patients and customers. </p><p>I wish to create more jobs, reduce poverty, and bring a prosperous and happy life to my employees and people around me. </p><p> These dreams are also the mission and the guideline to establish and develop of East Rose Dental Clinic and the entire East Rose Dental team members. </p><p> Therefore, I am looking forward to receiving the strong support of all the customers near and far all over the world to turn these dreams into reality. From my sincere heart, I always respect, acknowledge, and turn deep gratitude to all your support. </p><p> Thank you.</p><p><span class="theme-color">Dr. Thuy – The East Rose Dental Clinic</span></p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-xl-6 banner-left bg-full" style="background-image: url(/Content/Home/images/content/banner-left.jpg)"></div></div></div></div></div>
